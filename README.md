# DSA_case
This repository presents the development, analysis and conclusions of a *Data Science Analyst* case, using data analysis and *machine learning* techniques to explore a provided dataset. It may be constantly subject to change

The distribution of the repository is as follows:

1. data: contains the database

2. intermediates: contains intermediate files that serve as inputs or references between different tasks

3. tasks: subdivided into four distinct sections, each directory houses the requisite Python scripts designed to generate specific outcomes:
   
         EDA: eda.py
         cluster: clus.py
         model: compare_models.py, cv_params.py
         report: report.ipynb, report.pdf (currently only available in Spanish; an English version will be provided later)
   
5. outcomes: contains various folders, charts, HTML files, and .csv files that display all the results for a more detailed analysis of the data and the models than in the report.

(Please note that this repo is still in progress, so thete may be some small typos/mistakes throughout project)
