# DSA_case
This repository presents the development, analysis and conclusions of a *Data Science Analyst* case, using data analysis and *machine learning* techniques to explore a provided dataset. It may be constantly subject to change

## Case Development

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the features and relationships within the dataset.

### 2. Building Predictive Models

Developing models to predict relevant metrics, evaluating their performance using specific metrics.

### 3. Hyperparameter Optimization

Improving model performance through hyperparameter optimization.

### 4. Clustering Techniques

Applying clustering to identify patterns or segments in the data.

### 5. Unsupervised Learning

Using unsupervised learning techniques to uncover hidden insights in unlabeled data.

**Note 1:** While this report contains relevant information and key conclusions, the folders within this repository contain all outcomes, intermediates, code, and relevant files for a more detailed analysis. Reviewing these supplementary materials is recommended for a deeper understanding of the project.

**Note 2:** For interactive files like EDA-Profiling and 2D/3D Scatter... it might not be possible to view them on GitHub or PDF, so it is recommended to download the HTML files located in `outcomes/EDA` and `outcomes/model` respectively to open them in a browser.





The distribution of the repository is as follows:

1. data: contains the database

2. intermediates: contains intermediate files that serve as inputs or references between different tasks

3. tasks: subdivided into four distinct sections, each directory houses the requisite Python scripts designed to generate specific outcomes:
   
         EDA: eda.py
         cluster: clus.py
         model: compare_models.py, cv_params.py
         report: report.ipynb, report.pdf (currently only available in Spanish; an English version will be provided later)
   
5. outcomes: contains various folders, charts, HTML files, and .csv files that display all the results for a more detailed analysis of the data and the models than in the report.

(Please note that this repo is still in progress, so thete may be some small typos/mistakes throughout project)
